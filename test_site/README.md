# RIC Test site
This site contains test cases for the 'riclib.js' testing. You can add more cases which may contain different image types, css rules, image sizes, etc. Currently we are missing css `background-image` example completely.


## Improvements
This was quick solution to start 'riclib.js' development, because images can be viewed visually quickly. These could be done also using unit tests / e2e tests, but it would require some additional work to setup test framework.
